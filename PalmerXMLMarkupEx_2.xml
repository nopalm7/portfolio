        <line n="17">Or anything</line>
        <line n="18">So he slept on a mountain</line>
        <line n="19">In a sleeping bag underneath the stars</line>
        <line n="20">He would lie awake and count them</line>
        <line n="21">And the gray fountain spray of the great Milky Way</line>

<!--This song "Hummingbird", by the band Wilco, is one of my favorites. It holds significance from my childhood and I appreciate how simple lyrics can carry so much weight. My markups and attributes were mainly focused on highlighting the structure of the song, treating it as a poem by splitting it up line-by-line.-->
