        <h1>Noah's Beginning HTML</h1>
        <p>I have no clue what to type here which is
                <strong>awesome</strong>. Here is <a
                    href="https://psu.instructure.com/">a link to the PSU Canvas
            website</a>.</p>
        <p>There is apparently some HTML to be leaned from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3Schools</a>. 
            Here is the link for <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">color codes</a> in which I pulled the color Thistle.</p>
        <p>At this point I might use <strong>ChatGPT</strong> to come up with a good website idea for me.</p>
        <h2>Check out this cool heading with different types of lists underneath!</h2>
        <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. Here is a bulleted list with the colors of the rainbow.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>red</li>
            <li>orange</li>
            <li>yellow</li>
            <li>green</li>
            <li>blue</li>
            <li>indigo</li>
            <li>violet</li>
        </ul>
            
            <h3 style="background-color:DarkSlateBlue;">Brrrrrr</h3>
            <p style="background-color:PowderBlue;">This color reminds me of the snow.</p>       

        
        <h4>Might as well toss in another header here for fun</h4>
        
        <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very similar to the <q>unordered</q> list. 
            Here is a numbered list of numbers.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>five</li>
            <li>seven</li>
            <li>ten</li>
            <li>two</li>
            <li>nine</li>
        </ol>
