        <h2>Game: 3 Ninjas Kick Back</h2>
        
        <h3>This game is an old Super Nintendo side-scrolling action game based off of a film from 1994.</h3>

        <ul> 
            <li>The graphics are decent, with the rocky and viney ground creating a jungle-like world. It also has trees and branches that you can grab on to. The game audio is noticably grainy which is to be expected from an older Nintendo game.</li>
            <li>There are 3 characters to play as: Rocky, Colt, or Tum-Tum. They are all similar but posess different weapons and slightly different heights. Nothing too distinctive though.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it's hard to be able to find the way to go to complete the level. I was stuck on level 1 zone 3 most often because the endpoint was not very claer.</li>
            <li>You can pick up coins, a red fire bomb that instantly destroys enemies around, health points, and weapons to throw.</li>
            <li>The music is a bit goofy for the context of the game. It sounds pixelated, almost like a pitch off of Pacman and repeats during the duration of the gameplay. The menu and screens in between actions have music which is more fitting.</li>
            <li>The game doesn't appear to "comment" on itself other than giving instructions and context for the goal of the game, which is to find the old man's dagger and samurai sword that can open a door to a cave of gold.</li>
            <li>Being that this game is a simplistic and straight to the point action game, there is rarely any commentary and none of it relates to our reality or cultural issues.</li>
            <li>This game could use some improvement in the controls, especially when ran on the internet. I found the controls by guessing. It would also benefit from having an explanation of the controls and mechanics of the character.</li>
        </ul>
