        <p><strong>I chose to compare US President's Andrew Jackson and Donald Trump because ChatGPT said Jackson is the most comparable to Trump in personality and policy. I wanted to see if their speech is also comparable. Based on the n-grams they do seem somewhat similar, but also have clear distinctions. For starters, they both say "the united states" the most which is to be expected from most presidents. They both have "of the united" in thier top six 3-grams as well. You could predict they are both more patriotic and energetic due to these phrases because of the context in which they are normally used in a speech. One clear distinction lies in Trump's top 2 and 3 n-grams with "thank you very" and "you very much." Based on that it seems like Trump recieves praise and/or clapping and chanting during his speeches in which he feels obligated to thank the crowd for. Jackson has no similar phrases in his top 16, in fact his seem more serious with phrases such as "of the public," "of the government," "of the people," and "of the country. It can be inferred that Jackson is more blunt and to the point than Trump in his speeches due to his specific and consise references. Other than the simple wording about the United States, it would be almost impossible to predict that these two presidents are all that comparable in the first place. Overall, these presidents are very different in their speech styles based off of these n-grams. Trump seems to be more friendly while Jackson seems to be more direct.</strong></p>
